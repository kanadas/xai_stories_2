This book is the result of a student projects for [Interpretable Machine Learning](https://github.com/pbiecek/InterpretableMachineLearning2021) course at the University of Warsaw and the University of Łódź. Each team has prepared one case study for selected XAI technique.

The book chapters are written in the Markdown language.
The simulations, data examples and visualizations were created with R [@rlang] and Python.
The book was compiled with the [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) package.
We collaborated using [github repository](https://github.com/pbiecek/xai_stories_2).
