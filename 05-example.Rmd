## Introduction 



## Model 

### Product Categories

One of the first problems we faced was the categorization of products. We did not want to model sales of each product separately, but instead wanted to focus on a smaller amount of distinctively different categories. Below was explained the process that led to choosing 2 product categories of which sales were finally modelled: Garden and Home.  

Our initial approach was to automatically categorize products using polish word2vec embeddings and run K-Means clustering algorithm on vectorized product names. This proved to be problematic: Setting small number of clusters (between 5 and 15) resulted in seemingly unrelated products clumped in the same clusters. On the other hand, setting larger number of clusters resulted in too small number of products in each of them. Time series of total sales of such small 'categories' had low values and seemed to contain a lot of noise. Also, inspecting the quality of clusters required a lot of manual work.

This leads to a simpler approach that was actually used: simple categorization of products based on their names containing manually selected kewyords. There were 5 predetermined categories: Garden, Home, Clothes, Toy, Industry. If a product name contained a keyword (for example "taras" i.e. terrace in Polish) specific to one of these categories, it was enough to assign category label to it (in this case Garden). In total, there were 187 keywords used, which allowed to categorize 25.000 out of 40.000 product names, responsible for more than 70% of global sales. Morevoer, Garden and Home turned out to be responsible for more than 50% of global sales. Since in this project we were interested in the relationship between weather and product sales, they seemed like a great fit. Sales of Garden category products had a distinctive yearly seasonal pattern, unlike Home products.
